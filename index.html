		<h3>About Me</h3>

		<p>I have always been interested in business, and while in school & college I occassionally worked for my dad's construction company. I never really enjoyed the work I was doing (installing siding mainly), but one summer I learned how to build decks. For me, it was an entirely different experience. It involved more thought and creativity than siding ever did, and I really enjoyed putting a new structure together by hand, starting from scratch. After those few months of traning, I went into business for myself. I had a rough first year - things got busy very quickly and I wasn't able to properly manage my workload or deal with a new (bad) crew I hired. After a much-needed pause in the slow season, I started anew. This time I was much more focused on quality and customer service, and within a year or two I started earning rewards for good customer service & quality. </p>
		<p>About 4-5 years in, I had an outstanding reputation with more work than I or my crews could handle. Things sometimes got so busy that I didn't have time to sleep (while trying to raise a family at the same time)! But after reaching the "peak", I lost interest - the drive that I had in the beginning. For one thing, I no longer had the time to build and was mainly doing work I didn't enjoy (estimating, project management). I also tried (unsuccessfully) to find estimators and project managers to hire so that I could expand the business. Even though the income was great, I knew I had to get out. </p>
		<p>I considered going to school for engineering, but that path would take too long and there was no way that I could take care of my family at the same time. One day I had an idea for a program that I knew would help me in my business. I wasn't able to find it, or get anyone I knew to make it for me. That's when I decided that I needed to learn how to program! Which led to me selling my construction business and becoming a full-time student at the Galvanize Full Stack Program. </p>
